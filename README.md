# A/B Testing Project: Fintech Payment Gateway Promotions

### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of different promotions (Discount, Cashback, Free Trial, No Promotion) on the success rate of payments in an imaginary fintech payment gateway. By conducting an A/B test, we will explore how various incentives influence user behavior and identify the best strategies to increase successful payments.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on 4000 users and their interactions with the payment gateway, including demographic details, device usage, payment methods, and promotions. Some data cleaning is required, as there are missing values and outliers. The key features include:

- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Age**: Age of the user (with some missing values).
- **Gender**: Gender of the user (Male, Female, Non-binary).
- **Region**: Geographical region of the user (North, South, East, West).
- **Device**: Type of device used (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).
- **Payment_Method**: Preferred payment method (Credit Card, Debit Card, E-Wallet, Bank Transfer).
- **Promotion**: Type of promotion offered (Discount, Cashback, Free Trial, No Promotion).
- **Successful_Payment**: Whether the payment was successful (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Transaction_Amount**: Amount of the transaction (includes outliers).

### Steps for Analysis

1. **Objective Definition:**
   - The objective of the A/B test is to determine which promotion increases the likelihood of a successful payment.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values in columns like `Age` and `Promotion`.
   - Identify and deal with outliers in `Transaction_Amount`.
   - Convert categorical features (like `Gender` and `Region`) into appropriate formats for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the distribution of users across different age groups, regions, devices, and payment methods.
   - Analyze the success rate of payments for each promotion.

4. **Group Comparison (A/B Testing):**
   - Divide users into treatment (with promotions) and control (no promotion) groups.
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or chi-square tests) to check whether the promotions significantly impact payment success rates.

5. **Feature Segmentation:**
   - Segment users based on age groups, device types, regions, and other features to identify if any group is more responsive to promotions.

6. **Data Visualization:**
   - Use bar charts and heatmaps to show the relationship between age groups, promotion types, and successful payments.
   - Create visualizations to communicate key insights clearly.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize the findings and provide recommendations for the most effective promotions.
   - Suggest further steps for future experiments or optimizations.

### Dependencies

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **matplotlib**: For additional plotting features.
- **scipy**: For statistical analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.

### Future Work
- Perform deeper analysis on the impact of other factors like payment methods and regions on payment success.
- Conduct further tests with different types of promotions or incentives to optimize results.
